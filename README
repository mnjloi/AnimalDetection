Animal Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
------------------------------------------------------
This project waas created for Alpha Technion by Ariel Ramrajker and Alon Feldman.
This directory contains two things:
1. The code used to make the YOLOv2 model for animal detection.
2. A live-script version of that code.
This code is written for MATLAB 2022b.
The 'Imported Functions' used here are taken from https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/object-detection-using-yolo-v2.html
Thank you for reading!
